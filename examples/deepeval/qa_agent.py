Question Answering Agent with DeepEval Quality Controls

This example demonstrates:
1. Using agent-control SDK with @control() decorator
2. DeepEval GEval evaluators for quality enforcement
3. Handling ControlViolationError gracefully

The agent is protected by DeepEval-based controls that check:
- Response coherence (logical consistency)
- Answer relevance (stays on topic)
- Factual correctness (when expected outputs available)

Usage:
    # Setup first (creates controls on server)
    python setup_controls.py

    # Then run the agent
    python qa_agent.py

Requirements:
    - agent-control server running
    - OPENAI_API_KEY set (for DeepEval)
    - Controls configured via setup_controls.py
